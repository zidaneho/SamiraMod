### New Content
- Lots of new skills!

### Primary:
- **Explosive Shot**: Samira may only shoot her guns now, but every 4 attacks she fires an explosive shot which deals a high amount of damage. This unique attack does not grant a style point like Flair.
- **Slashing Maniac**: Samira may only swing her sword now, but every time she hits an enemy, she will gain a movement speed and attack speed buff. This buff may infinitely stack, but has a duration. Additionally, this ability inherits Flair's unique attack, and does grant its style point.

### Secondary:
- **Exposing Whirl**: Just like Blade Whirl, but Samira will only damage her enemies once (in the beginning). Instead, Samira fires armor-penetrating bullets at nearby enemies.

### Utility:
- **Quick Steps**: Samira gains two charges of dash. On press, Samira gains attack speed for a duration.

### Special:
- **Infinite Rain**: Samira unleashes a volley of bullets at nearby enemies. When enemies are killed, the duration of the ability is extended.

## Patch 1.0.0
- Initial Release
